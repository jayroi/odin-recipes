    <h2>From Frozen to your Mouth</h2>
    <p>
        Listen, if you go down the freezer aisle and eggos
        are on sale, don't even think. Just buy them. 
        Not only do you get an unhealthy breakfast, you get 
        you daily dose of sugar from all the syrup you are
        going to put in each of these little squares. This is 
        one of the easiest and fastest ways to get your morning
        going.
